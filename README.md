# 🍽 KL Eats - Food Ordering Website

KL Eats is an innovative platform designed to streamline campus dining for students and faculty. Our mission is to provide a convenient way to pre-order and book meals from various canteens across our campus.

This project was developed with the invaluable support of *KL GLUG (GNU/Linux User Group)*, showcasing the power of open-source collaboration in creating practical solutions for our campus community.
